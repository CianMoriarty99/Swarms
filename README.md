## Getting Started

Download the zip file from the repository

Extract it to a convenient location

Download Version “2019.1.8f1” from the Hub

“Add” project folder

Open project.

In the “Scenes” Folder, Open the X Scene

Try running the simulation with the play button

Check for compiler errors

## Changing the Simulation

You can change the size of the box by increasing the scale components in the transform of the “Level” object.

If you want to toggle the third person camera in the simulation, press the “Space” Key
(You can change this Key in CameraSwitch.cs)

While the Sim is running, go into the Settings folder and click on settings

In the top right you should see all the settings from the Scripts/Settings.cs file.

Here you can change the parameters to see how the Boids behaviour changes

What happens when you change the perception radius from 0.1 to 10?

Note: If you set the Steer force to less than about 2 then they have trouble steering in time to avoid the walls and they’ll glitch through it. Anywhere from 4 - 6 is a good value.

Interestingly, if you set the Steer force to a really high value then they start to slow down, what could be the reason for this?

Try changing the weights from 0.1 to 1 - Values above 1.5 tend to get a bit messy
